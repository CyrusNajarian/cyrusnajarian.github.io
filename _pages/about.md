I'm an MD-PhD student being co-advised by Prof. Jeffrey Fessler and Prof. Jon-Frederick Nielsen at the University of Michigan in the department of Biomedical Engineering. My research interests include applying signal and image processing, computational imaging, and machine learning to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics to improve patient outcomes. Clinincally, I'm interested in Neurology, specifically vascular neurology.
